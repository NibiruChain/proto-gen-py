## Python Code Generation

All you need to do is run:

```sh
make proto-gen
```

This executes the code generation script, [proto-gen-py.sh][script-proto-gen]. The protobuf files come from the [NibiruChain/nibiru repo][repo-nibiru].

## Other Development Guidelines

Our recommended Python setup is to use `pyenv` in combination with `poetry`.

- `pyenv` is a tool for installing and managing Python interpreters. This will let you seamlessly switch between Python versions.
- `poetry` is used for managing virtual environments, dependency resolution, package installations, package building, and package publishing.
- We assume you're on a Unix machine such as WSL2 Ubuntu, MacOS, or a common Linux distro.

See [NibiruChain/py-sdk][repo-py-sdk] for installation instructions.

## Testing

```sh
poetry install
poetry run pytest
```

## Publishing to PyPI

The publish workflow looks like this:

1. Code-gen the new types from the chain. If there are changes, these should be committed.

   ```sh
   make proto-gen
   ```

2. Increment the package version. For example, use `poetry version preminor` to do a pre-release for a minor version.

   ```sh
   poetry version [update-keyword]
   ```

3. Create a tag and push it the remote origin.

   ```sh
   git tag -asm "v0.16.2" v0.16.2
   git push --tags
   ```

4. The tag should trigger a [GitHub Action Workflow](https://github.com/NibiruChain/sdk-proto-gen/actions/workflows/publish-to-test-pypi.yml).
